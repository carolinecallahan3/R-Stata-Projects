# R and Stata Projects Repository
This repository contains my projects in **R** and **Stata**, focusing on political science and econometric research, respectively.

## Repository Contents
There are two projects contained in this repository. The R Markdown file `DAV_Project_Spring_Final_Callahan.rmd` explores how the level of congressional diversity,
an indicator of the openness of the political opportunity structure, affects the advancement of common social movement goals. Congressional diversity is measured over
time via the changing proportions of African Americans, Asian Americans, Hispanic Americans, and women in both the United States House of Representatives and Senate.
The number of congressional hearings held regarding the social movement topic serves as a proxy for government responsiveness, an approach common in the social
movement literature (Jeydel 2000). In this study, hearings regarding civil rights and social welfare, two historically popular missions of social movements, are of interest.

The data used in this project was sourced from two different data sets: Brookings Institute’s Vital Statistics Demographics of members of Congress data set and the U.S. 
Policy Agendas Project’s Congressional Hearings data set. Vital Statistics is a decades-long project dedicated to collecting a variety of data related to Congress and
its trends. Teams from the American Enterprise Institute and the Campaign Finance Institute helped to update the data set used in this project in November 2022. It was 
accessed from the Brookings Institute’s website. The U.S. Policy Agendas Project is directed by Bryan Jones from the University of Texas at Austin, in collaboration with a
large staff representing many different American universities. The team uses archival sources to build data sets that track American policy agenda trends since 1940.
The Congressional Hearings data set was accessed on the project’s website; it is part of the Parliamentary and Legislative data collection series.

The second project contained is this repository explores the research question of whether a rise in minimum wage affects employment by increasing or decreasing the 
unemployment rate. The coded materials consist of a Stata Log file under the name `ECON_308_Econometrics_Wage_and_Employment_Final_Log.smcl` and a Stata Do file under the name
`ECON_308_Econometrics_Wage_and_Employment_FINAL_Do.do`. The research report based on the econometric Stata analysis is also located in this repository under the file name 
`Caroline_Callahan_ECON_308_Econometrics_Wage_and_Employment_Final_Research_Report.pdf`. A difference-in-differences approach is adopted to understand how a minimum wage
increase in 2014 in Arkansas affected employment relative to employment in the state of Mississippi, which had no such law change. The econometric approach was chosen for
its ability to isolate the effect of the minimum wage change by comparing the difference of the pre- and post-treatment period differences in employment rates between
Arkansas and Mississippi. 

The data was collected from IPUM CPS, a public database that stores all data from the Current Population Survey (Flood, et al. 2024). The experiment uses individual level
data and spans from 2008-2018; the pre-treatment cutoff is the year 2014. In line with conventional economic theory, it was hypothesized that Arkansas’ policy change did
have an effect on employment rate in the post-2014 period. However, the experiment finds no statistically significant evidence to support a rejection of the null hypothesis.
The finding aligns with other literature in the field that contradicts conventional theory about the relationship between minimum wage and employment.
